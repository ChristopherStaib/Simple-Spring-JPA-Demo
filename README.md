# Simple-Spring-JPA-Demo

Simple Spring JPA Demo Application without styling to display exposure with Create, Read, Update, and Delete Operations in Java. 

Through the interface, operations to access and utilize a temporary database are available to interact with adding people's information like ID and name. 

To run the application, open in preferred IDE (I used VSCode) and open browser to localhost:8080.
